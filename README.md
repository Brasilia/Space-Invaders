# Space-Invaders

(2013)

A game presented to Fellowship of the Game (https://www.fog.icmc.usp.br/) in order to join it in 2013.

The code is kinda messy (not at all a good example of headers and implementation files) but the game did work fine for it's purpose and scope. All graphics were created by myself, all sounds except SEs (which were not included in the build - and are credited nonetheless) were created by myself.
